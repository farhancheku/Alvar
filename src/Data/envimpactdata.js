ALVAR Mist replaces the traditional methods. After a basic cleaning of the processing waste, Alvar creates a dense disinfection mist that envelops, infiltrates, penetrates and attacks harmful microbes. This allows users to save up to 90% of water and between 50-70% chemicals, dramatically improving the sustainability of the food chain and protecting product and people",
