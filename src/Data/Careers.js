      "Ragnar owned and captained a trawling fleet for over 30 years in the north of Iceland. During this time, Ragnar learnt from the inside the challenges that salmon and fish producers must face. Trying to find a system to improve the efficiency of his fleet, Ragnar invented the original design of Alvar’s misting system. A complete solution to avoid bacteria outbreaks in the fish and salmon processing trawlers and factories.The invention was finally even better than expected. Besides combatting bacteria and avoiding contaminated products, the system also allowed companies to improve their sustainability by saving water, chemicals, and staff costs. Moreover, the solution was easily adapted to protect businesses in other industries, like meat and poultry",
