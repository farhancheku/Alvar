            ques : "Q1:   What is ALVAR?",
            ans : "ALVAR was founded in Iceland, where our technology has been designed and developed. The name ALVAR means ‘’total protection’’ in Icelandic, and it is derived from its success in attacking microbes, reinforcing food safety, and reducing waste of water and chemicals. ALVAR’s technology has been successfully tried and tested in a world leading food production industry, Iceland ‘s fisheries. Since then, it has been adapted to protect leading companies in the entire food processing industry, and it has been installed in hundreds of food processing factories and trawlers around the world, offering stability and support to contain possible threats.",

            ques : "Q2:   What is Mist?",
            ans : "ALVAR systems offer holistic, pragmatic, 360° mist solutions that can reach the most difficult areas in any food production line to combat harmful microbes (bacteria, virus, and fungi). ALVAR Mist systems are tailor-made, fully automatic, and remote controlled. ALVAR can disinfect a 3.500 square meter factory by penetrating and attacking bacteria in 30 minutes, saving 90% of water, 50 to 70% of chemicals and 100% of labour costs during the disinfection process. This will also increase the product shelf-life by 1-2 days and reduce food-waste.",
        },
        {
            ques : "Q3:   Are ALVAR solutions customisable?",
            ans : "Yes. We know the food industry inside out and we rarely install two identical systems in two different companies. The density of the mist needed will depend on the distribution of machinery, the kind of product processed and how the mist must work, by penetrating, enveloping, infiltrating, or attacking. The necessary antiseptic properties and the bacteria levels expected in the area are also important factors. At ALVAR, we can customise our solutions to efficiently combat bacteria, increase food safety, and fight costs. ",

            ques : "Q4:   Are ALVAR solutions environmentally friendly?",
            ans : "At ALVAR, we are committed to conserve resources by reducing use of water and chemicals. ALVAR’s holistic and pragmatic solutions increase the products’ shelf life by 1-2 days, which also contributes to minimising food-waste. Our systems replace the traditional methods, which are very wasteful in water and chemical use. Instead of that, ALVAR allows users to save up to 90% of water and between 50-70% chemicals, dramatically improving the sustainability of the food chain.",

            ques : "Q6:   Do I need to stop using my current chemicals if I install ALVAR?",
            ans : "No. Besides offering state-of-the-art technology to deliver the best defence and most efficient protection in the market, ALVAR does not require its users to purchase any specific chemical. Our systems have been designed to be compatible with some of the most commonly used chemicals in the market, like Diversey, Ecolab or Kersia, or any other water-soluble chemical.",

We believe that our systems are highly reliable, and for that reason, the most difficult challenges are accepted by ALVAR operations for casework examples and can be granted an ALVAR trial case.",

This is possible thanks to a tailor-made design and installation of ALVAR Mist Core guaranteeing the exact mist density needed given the size of the specific facility, the machinery being used, and product processed.",

This is possible thanks to a tailor-made design and installation of ALVAR Mist Core guaranteeing the exact mist density needed given the size of the specific facility, the machinery being used, and product processed.",
