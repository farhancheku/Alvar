        "“The usage of the ALVAR system in Arnarlax began early in October 2020. After using the ALVAR system it has become easier to keep the slaughtering process clean, and it seems like dirt does not stick to machinery as much where there is no constant water flow, as a result, the frequency of too high ATP measurements has been reduced. The technology system was also installed in vacuum machines/pipes that suck out intestines and ATP measurements have dropped from 7000 before ALVAR installation to 3000. Since there is not an efficient DIP system in these pipes it is unrealistic to lower these numbers to 0. But before the ALVAR system was installed, the ATP numbers were sometimes over 10.000. This technical system has been very helpful in fighting Listeria, in general, the system has helped us with lowering all ATP numbers and keeping track of possible Listeria infections. In places where Listeria numbers have raised a red flag the system has helped us to find the patient zero (equipment/machinery) and with relatively easy actions we have changed the product line so that it will become easier to clean the origin of the infection. It is my opinion that the ALVAR system is a vital and good tool to get better results in the fight against Listeria.”",
